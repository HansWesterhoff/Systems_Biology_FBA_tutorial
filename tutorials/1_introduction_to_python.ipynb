    "Here, `1:3` represents a **slice** going from element `1` _included_ (this is the second element of the list) to element `3` _excluded_. Thus, we get a sublist with the second and third element of the original list. The first-included/last-excluded asymmetry leads to an intuitive treatment of overlaps between consecutive slices. Also, note that a sublist refers to a dynamic *view* of the original list, not a copy; changing elements in the sublist automatically changes them in the original list."
