    "## Phenylalanine Catabolism Is Genetically Defective in Some People}\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Assignment (10 min):**</span> Read the text below and study the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is taking from Lehninger's principles of biochemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that many amino acids are either neuro-transmitters or precursors or antagonists of neutrotransmitters, genetic defects of amino acid metabolism can cause defective neural development and mental retardation. In most such diseases specific intermediates accumulate. For example, a genetic defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase, the first enzyme in the catabolic pathway for phenylalanine, is responsible for the disease phenylketonuria (PKU), the most common cause of elevated levels of phenylalanine (hyperphenylalaninemia). Phenylalanine hydroxylase (also called phenylalanine-4-monooxygenase) is one of a general class of enzymes called mixed-function oxidases, all of which catalyze simultaneous hydroxylation of a substrate by an oxygen atom of $O_2$ and reduction of the other oxygen atom to $H_2O$. Phenylalanine hydroxylase requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, which carries electrons from NADH to $O_2$ and becomes oxidized to dihydrobiopterin in the process. It is subsequently reduced by the enzyme dihydrobiopterin reductase in a reaction that requires NADH.\n",
    "\n",
    "In individuals with PKU, a secondary, normally little-used pathway of phenylalanine metabolism comes into play. In this pathway phenylalanine undergoes transamination with pyruvate to yield phenylpyruvate. Phenylalanine and phenylpyruvate accumulate in the blood and tissues and are excreted in the urine—hence the name “phenylketonuria.” Much of the phenylpyruvate, rather than being excreted as such, is either decarboxylated to phenylacetate or reduced to phenyllactate. Phenylacetate imparts a characteristic odor to the urine, which nurses have traditionally used to detect PKU in infants. The accumulation of phenylalanine or its metabolites in early life impairs normal development of the brain, causing severe mental retardation. This may be caused by excess phenylalanine competing with other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier, resulting in a deficit of required metabolites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenylketonuria was among the first inheritable metabolic defects discovered in humans. When this condition is recognized early in infancy, mental retardation can largely be prevented by rigid dietary control. The diet must supply only enough phenylalanine and tyrosine to meet the needs for protein synthesis. Consumption of protein-rich foods must be curtailed. Natural proteins, such as casein of milk, must first be hydrolyzed and much of the phenylalanine removed to provide an appropriate diet, at least through childhood. Because the artificial sweetener aspartame is a dipeptide of aspartate and the methyl ester of phenylalanine, foods sweetened with aspartame bear warnings addressed to individuals on phenylalanine-controlled diets.\n",

    "**Figure 1:** Catabolic pathways for phenylalanine and tyrosine. In humans these amino acids are normally converted to acetoacetyl-CoA and fumarate. Genetic defects in many of these enzymes cause inheritable human diseases (shaded yellow). Source: Lehninger. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also see Figure 1 from below for a pathway visualization of some more common IEMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenylketonuria can also be caused by a defect in the enzyme that catalyzes the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin. The treatment in this case is more complex than restricting the intake of phenylala- nine and tyrosine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetrahydrobiopterin is also required for the formation of L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) and 5-hydroxytryptophan precursors of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin, respectively and in phenylketonuria of this type, these pre- cursors must be supplied in the diet. Supplementing the diet with tetrahydrobiopterin itself is ineffective because it is unstable and does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\n",
