# Tutorial on Python and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
This repository contains all files and code pertaining to the flux balance analysis practicals taught as part of the systems medicine course at the VU (Free University Amsterdam) in 2016 & 2017. 

# Reproducible analysis
We use [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. By clicking on the "binder" button above you will be redirected to a webpage that will generate a personal jupyter container for you. After a while it will be launched. You will see a folder with files. Start the "Start_here_tutorial_hub". This notebook will link to all tutorials we use in the course. The notebooks should be self-explanatory. If you run into problems, ask one of the teaching assistants. 

**List of tools we use:**
- [MyBinder](http://mybinder.org/) a collection of tools for building and executing version-controlled computational environments that contain code, data, and interactive front ends
- [CobraPy](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy) A package for constraint-based modeling of biological networks
- [Escher](https://escher.github.io) Build, share, and embed visualizations of biological pathways.
- [Cameo](https://github.com/biosustain/cameo) Metabolic engineering & optimization on top of CobraPy
