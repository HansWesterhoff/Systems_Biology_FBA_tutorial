# Tutorial on Python and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
This repository contains all files and code pertaining to the flux balance analysis practicals taught as part of the systems medicine course at the VU (Free University Amsterdam) in 2016 & 2017. 

**List of tools we use:**
- [MyBinder](http://mybinder.org/) a collection of tools for building and executing version-controlled computational environments that contain code, data, and interactive front ends
- [CobraPy](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy) A package for constraint-based modeling of biological networks
- [Escher](https://escher.github.io) Build, share, and embed visualizations of biological pathways.
- [Cameo](https://github.com/biosustain/cameo) Metabolic engineering & optimization on top of CobraPy

# Reproducible analysis
We use [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. By clicking on the "binder" button above a jupyter notebook will be launched. This notebook will link to all tutorials we use in the course. 

# Manual
The manual is available as a pdf file. Either follow the link in the notebook or download it by navigating to the "Instructions" folder above. Download the pdf file "Manual_tutorial_systems_medicine.pdf" contained in that folder.
