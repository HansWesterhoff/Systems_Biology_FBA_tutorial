# Welcome to the tutorial
This Github repository contains all materials related to the flux balance analysis practicals taught as part of the systems biology and medicine course at the VU (Free University Amsterdam) in 2016 - 2018. 

# Start the tutorial
We will use [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) to run [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the cloud. By clicking on the "launch binder" button at the top of the page you will be redirected to a webpage that will generate a personal jupyter container for you. After a while the notebook server will be launched. You will see a folder with files. Open the "Start_here_tutorial_hub". This notebook will link to all tutorials we use in the course. 

# Tips
It is recommended that you work in pairs and **use a browser other than internet explorer!**

Each time that you launch Binder you will end up in a new and independent environment. You are therefore free to modify the files in your own environment without risk to other students. However, it also means your progress will not be saved across sessions!

The contents of the tutorial are organized over several notebooks. Each notebook contains explanations of key concepts and how to interact with the notebook, python and the human metabolic reconstruction. The notebooks should be self-explanatory. 

Throughout you will occasionally see small assignments that are designed so that you actually interact with the software and the models.

If you run into problems, ask one of the teaching assistants. 

# Most important... 
Don't forget to have fun!
