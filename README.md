# Welcome to the tutorial
This Github repository contains all materials related to a collection of flux balance analysis practicals taught as part of the systems biology and medicine course at the VU (Free University Amsterdam) in 2016 - 2018 and at the [ECI 2018](http://www.eci2018.org). 

# Start the tutorial
We will use [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) to run [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the cloud. By clicking on the "launch binder" button at the top of the page you will be redirected to a webpage that will generate a personal jupyter container for you. After a while the notebook server will be launched. You will see a folder with files. Open the one of the "XX_tutorial_hub" files.

# Tips
It is critical that **use a browser other than internet explorer!**

It is recommended that you work in pairs, especially if the group is large, to reduce server stress.

If you run into problems, ask one of the teaching assistants. 

# Most important... 
Don't forget to have fun!
