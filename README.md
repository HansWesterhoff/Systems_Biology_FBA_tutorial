# Welcome to the VU and UvA flux balance analysis tutorial
This Github repository contains all materials related to a collection of flux balance analysis practicals taught as part of the systems biology and medicine course at the VU (Free University Amsterdam) in 2016 - 2019 and at the [ECI 2018](http://www.eci2018.org). 

# Start the tutorial
We will use [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) to run [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the cloud. By clicking on the "launch binder" button at the top of this page you will be redirected to a webpage that will generate a personal jupyter container for you. 

After a while the notebook server will be launched. You will see a folder with files. Open the  "VUA_course_tutorial_hub" file. 

# Important notes & tips
- It is critical that you **use a browser other than internet explorer: i.e. Google Chrome, Safari or Firefox.**

- Your work is not saved on the server. So manually export and download the workbooks if you want to keep them. However, you can always go back and start the tutorial again on any machine at any time in the future.

- If you run into problems, ask one of the teaching assistants. 

- If the group size is large, it is recommended that you work in pairs to reduce server stress.
