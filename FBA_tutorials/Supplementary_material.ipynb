This article explains and shows with demonstrations how scholarly \"papers\" can morph into long-lasting rich records of scientific discourse, enriched with deep data and code linkages, interactive figures, audio, video, and commenting. It includes an interactive d3.js visualization and has an astronomical data figure with an IPYthon Notebook \"behind\" it."
