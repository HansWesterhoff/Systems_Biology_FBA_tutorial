    "\n",
    ">- **Luminal 1** (Luminal A) breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive ER+ or PR+ (estrogen-receptor and/or progesterone-receptor positive), HER2 negative (HER2 -), and has low levels of the protein Ki-67, which helps control how fast cancer cells grow. Luminal 1 cancers are low-grade, tend to grow slowly and have the best prognosis.\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **Luminal 2** (Luminal B) breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive (estrogen-receptor and/or progesterone-receptor positive), and either HER2 positive or HER2 negative with high levels of Ki-67. Luminal 2 cancers generally grow slightly faster than luminal A cancers and their prognosis is slightly worse.\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **HER2-enriched** breast cancer is hormone-receptor negative (estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor negative) and HER2 positive. HER2-enriched cancers tend to grow faster than luminal cancers and can have a worse prognosis, but they are often successfully treated with targeted therapies aimed at the HER2 protein, such as Herceptin (chemical name: trastuzumab), Perjeta (chemical name: pertuzumab), Tykerb (chemical name: lapatinib), and Kadcyla (chemical name: T-DM1 or ado-trastuzumab emtansine).\n",

This type of cancer is more common in women with BRCA1 gene mutations. Researchers aren’t sure why, but this type of cancer also is more common among younger and African-American women.\n",

    "Our approach for integrating the transcriptomics data with the metabolic network is based on [Damiani et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/30/256644). This approach was originally devised to deal with single cell transcriptomics but is here modified to apply across different cell lines. We will explain the details below, but beware as the details can be tricky to understand if you are new to flux balance analysis. Don't despair! You do not have to understand it 100%. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The approach in a nutshell (NOTE THAT THIS PART IS OPTIONAL TO UNDERSTAND)\n",
    "The key idea is to normalize each gene's transcriptomic level in a given cell line by the sum total across all four cell lines. This leads to transcriptomics \"score\" between 0 and 1. 0 if the transcript level is 0 in a particular cell line and 1 if that cell line was the only one to have any expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then take the unconstrained Recon 3 model and determine for each reaction what the maximal flux is that it can sustain on the defined medium. That maximal flux is then multiplied by the transcriptomics score and this product is set as the maximal flux bound in the model.\n",

    "### The details: two thorny problems (feel free to skip if you're in a hurry)\n",

    "- (1) The former is dealt with by summing up transcriptomic scores across isoenzymes for each reaction and taking the minimum transcriptomics score for components of an enzyme complex for each reaction. \n",
    "- (2) is solved by not setting reactions to zero if there is no transcript levels detected, but rather to a very low flux bound 1e-3. This way we will still be able to see bottlenecks (their flux will hit the 1e-3 bound) but we ensure that the model will keep functioning at all times (no pathways will be fully blocked).\n",
