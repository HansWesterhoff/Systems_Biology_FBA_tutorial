        "We present a new computational approach for systematically predicting the pattern of metabolic biomarkers characterizing each metabolic disorder whose causative gene is included in the human metabolic network model (Duarte et al, 2007). Let a boundary metabolite denote a metabolite that is known to be taken-up or secreted between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let an exchange interval denote a possible range of uptake and secretion fluxes of a given boundary exchange interval. For each metabolic disorder and each boundary metabolite, we predict its exchange interval between human tissues and biofluids, for both healthy and disease cases. This exchange interval is computed through a CBM method called flux variability analysis (FVA) (Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003), which accounts for the entire space of feasible flux states that satisfy mass-balance stoichiometric constraints and reaction directionality constraints (embedded in the model of (Duarte et al, 2007)). \n",
        "\n",
        "For the healthy case, the exchange interval is computed while the reactions affected by the disease are constrained to be active, whereas for the disease case, they are constrained to be inactive. By comparing the predicted exchange interval between the healthy state and the disease state for each boundary metabolite, one can determine whether the pertaining boundary metabolite concentration in biofluids (termed biomarker) is expected to be elevated, reduced or unchanged. \n",
        "\n",
        "If the predicted changes are marked such that there is no overlap between the exchange intervals of the healthy case and the disease case, the predicted biomarker change is considered to be highly confident.\n",
        "\nAn illustrative example of the predicted biomarker changes' ranges and their underlying rationale for the healthy state and some disease state is depicted in Figures 1A and B. The predicted exchange intervals of metabolite M1 (M2) suggest that its extracellular concentration is elevated (reduced) in the disease case. The disjoint exchange intervals obtained for the healthy case and the disease case for both M1 and M2 render these predictions as highly confident. The exchange intervals of metabolite M6 (M4) suggest that their extracellular concentrations are elevated (reduced) in the disease case. Examining, for example, the exchange interval of metabolite M6 shows that in the healthy case, M6 can be either taken-up from biofluids or secreted in a lower rate (as some of it is required in the healthy state; Supplementary Figure 1). In the disease case, M6 (synthesized through M5) can only be secreted to biofluids. It should be noted that mass-balance stoichiometric constraints that play an important role in determining the exchange intervals of different metabolites and are accounted for by the CBM method (and as will be shown, play an important role in determining biomarker changes in addition to the network topology) are not depicted in this kind of illustration."
